# Quillow package contract v1

Checked against `quillow-apis` on 2026-10-26:
`apps/api/internal/services/widget_packages/archive.go`, its tests, and
`apps/widget-host/README.md`. The backend remains the authority.

```text
block.zip
├── manifest.json
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── app.mjs
├── runtime.js
└── assets/
    └── photo.webp
```

No outer project directory. Only the manifest and HTML entrypoint are required.
The starter also includes the pinned SDK's standalone `runtime.js`; keep it in
the ZIP and load it before author scripts. Do not include SDK source maps or npm
package metadata. Runtime injection by the upload pipeline is not assumed.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "name": "Consultation calculator",
  "entrypoint": "index.html"
}
```

## Manifest

- Exactly `manifest.json` at the ZIP root; at most 16 KiB, valid UTF-8 JSON.
- Use exactly the three property names above, with no extra properties.
- `schemaVersion`: integer literal `1`.
- `name`: nonblank after whitespace trimming, at most 80 Unicode characters.
- `entrypoint`: valid package path ending in lowercase `.html`, identifying a
  file that exists with exactly the same case. Nested entrypoints are allowed.
- No additional JSON value after the manifest. The manifest is not served.

The local tools enforce this canonical form. They can be stricter than incidental
Go JSON-decoder behavior (for example, case-insensitive keys or replacement of
malformed Unicode); those decoder quirks are not an authoring contract.

## Files and paths

Allowed extensions, case sensitive:
`.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.mjs`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`, `.ico`,
`.woff`, `.woff2`. `manifest.json` is the only JSON-file exception.

No standalone SVG, JSON, source maps, TypeScript, Markdown, package files, or ZIPs
inside the ZIP. Embed static data in HTML/JS; use supported image formats.

Paths use only ASCII letters, numbers, `_`, `-`, `.`, and `/`, up to 240 characters.
No absolute paths, backslashes, empty segments, `.` or `..` segments, hidden
segments, or percent encoding. Paths are unique ignoring case; a file cannot also
be the parent of another file. Only regular files and directories are allowed:
no symlinks, device files, or encrypted entries. Use standard stored/deflated ZIPs.

## Limits

| Item                                          | Maximum                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Complete ZIP                                  | 10 MiB (10,485,760 bytes) |
| Total expanded files, including manifest      | 30 MiB (31,457,280 bytes) |
| Individual file                               | 10 MiB                    |
| Manifest                                      | 16 KiB (16,384 bytes)     |
| Entries, including explicit directory entries | 100                       |
| Path                                          | 240 ASCII characters      |

## Tool behavior

`package.mjs <directory> <output.zip>` checks the directory, builds an archive,
validates the resulting bytes, then writes a new file. It rejects unsupported or
hidden files rather than silently omitting them, except for `.DS_Store`.
These macOS metadata entries are automatically skipped at every depth and do not
count toward package limits. The original files are left untouched. Existing
ZIPs containing `.DS_Store` are still rejected by the validator and backend.

The output ZIP must be outside the input directory; existing outputs are never
overwritten. Empty directories are omitted from the ZIP, but the input tree is
conservatively limited to 100 entries including directories.

`validate.mjs <archive.zip>` checks ZIP metadata, paths, manifest, entrypoint,
actual decompressed bytes and CRC checksums without extracting or executing files.
Both commands return a nonzero exit code on failure.

Neither tool checks JavaScript behavior, local resource references, accessibility,
or visual layout. These require source review and, when available, browser tests.
