description: Create or edit a responsive Quillow Custom Code block and deliver a validated, upload-ready ZIP with manifest.json. Use for custom Quillow widgets, local interactive blocks, calculators, or changes to existing block packages.
compatibility: Requires Node.js 22.20+ and an agent able to create files and run commands. Browser testing is optional and requires browser tools.

# Quillow Custom Block

Deliver a polished static block and an actual ZIP the user can upload to Quillow.
Respond in the user's language. This skill works with any compatible coding agent;
do not assume a particular editor, terminal tool, installation path, or browser tool.

## Workflow

1. Read [the package contract](references/package-contract.md),
   [the runtime guide](references/runtime-and-layout.md), and
   [the design guide](references/design-guide.md).
2. Determine the purpose, essential content, interaction, assets, data, links,
   and visual direction. Use information already supplied and ask only questions
   that materially affect implementation. If the brief is incomplete, begin with:
   **What kind of block would you like to build?** Ask unresolved questions one
   at a time, then stop when the remaining decisions can be reasonably inferred.
   Do not ask which Quillow size to target or ask the user for pixel dimensions:
   every block must support small, medium, and large.
3. If the user asks for something basic or simple, says “match Quillow,”
   “general Quillow,” or “default Quillow,” or provides no visual direction,
   read and apply [the default style](references/default-style.md). Do not ask for
   a screenshot or invent an art direction from the content subject. A specific
   style request or copied creative prompt overrides the default; preserve its
   concept while improving fit, accessibility, and reliability.
4. The bundled SDK supplies live theme, layout, and editor/published context.
   Resolve requests for remote APIs, persistent state, or Quillow account/page
   data with the user before coding: those capabilities remain unavailable.
   Do not invent them or silently substitute fake data.
5. Find the installed directory containing this `SKILL.md`; call its absolute
   path `SKILL_DIR`. Check `node --version` (22.20+). Scripts and references are
   relative to this directory, not to the user's working directory. No package
   installation, Python, or system ZIP tool is needed.
6. For a new block, copy the contents of `templates/starter/` to a new working
   directory such as `my-block/` and customize them. Never edit the installed
   template. Prefer plain HTML/CSS/JS. Keep source/build tooling outside the
   directory that will be packaged. Replace all starter content and give the
   manifest a descriptive name.
   Keep the local `runtime.js` script before author scripts. It supplies
   `window.Quillow` and auto-starts inside an iframe. Do not load a second
   bundled ESM SDK instance alongside it.
7. For an existing block, inspect the files before editing and preserve unrelated
   behavior and user content. If only a ZIP was supplied, validate it first with
   `validate.mjs`, then use an available archive tool to extract it into a fresh
   directory while preserving paths. If extraction is unavailable, ask for the
   extracted files. Do not overwrite the original ZIP. Revisions use a new output
   filename.
8. Implement accessible controls, input validation, clear empty/error states, and
   responsive layouts using SDK size attributes, with these baseline test viewports:

   - Small: 156 × 156
   - Medium: 336 × 156
   - Large: 336 × 336

   Use `data-quillow-size` for composition and actual available dimensions for
   fitting content. Page viewport mode is distinct from block size. Keep CSS
   fallbacks for initial rendering and previews without host context.

   Treat these as three intentional compositions, not one canvas scaled up or
   down. Remove low-priority framing before shrinking type, truncating essential
   content, or adding scrollbars. Check every HTML/CSS/JS resource reference
   against the exact packaged filename, including capitalization; the archive
   validator does not inspect references.

9. If browser tools are available, serve the files through local HTTP and test in
   a sandboxed iframe with the documented CSP and CORS headers. Test all three
   exact viewports, keyboard interaction, touch/pointer behavior, reduced motion,
   live theme/font/layout changes without losing state, and the main interaction.
   Plain `file://` or an unsandboxed tab is not a runtime
   compatibility check. Fix clipping, overlap, accidental scrolling, tiny targets,
   and unreadable text rather than reporting them as expected limitations. If no
   browser is available, say that visual/runtime checks were not performed.
10. Run the bundled commands, quoting paths with spaces:

    ```sh
    node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/package.mjs" ./my-block ./my-block.zip
    node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate.mjs" ./my-block.zip
    ```

    Replace `SKILL_DIR` with the actual path using the environment's syntax. The
    output must be outside the input directory and must not already exist. Resolve
    errors and rerun the relevant checks. Do not report success before the commands
    succeed. Do not include the skill itself in the widget ZIP.

11. Provide the actual ZIP download/attachment when supported; otherwise provide
    its full local path. Summarize the block in one or two sentences, state which
    checks ran, and note any intentionally reduced behavior at a particular size.
    Instruct the user to select the ZIP in Quillow's Custom Code upload control.
    Upload/application is handled by Quillow; there is no separate publish step
    in v1. Keep editable files for later revisions.

## Completion rules

- Never claim a ZIP exists if the environment only produced text/code snippets.
  If commands or file creation are unavailable, explain the limitation and provide
  runnable steps instead of a fictitious download link.
- A valid ZIP does not prove JavaScript behavior or visual quality. Report archive
  validation separately from browser checks.
- Package scripts and assets locally: no CDN scripts, analytics, remote APIs,
  secrets, server-side code, or installation steps inside the generated block.
  Host-provided font stylesheets managed by the SDK are the supported external
  font exception; do not add arbitrary remote fonts.
- Do not add manifest properties for height, permissions, theme, or resizing.
